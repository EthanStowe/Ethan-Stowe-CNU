## Using Oxygen and XML

For this project I was asked to markup pages 20 through 23 of Charlotte Perkins Stetson’s *“The Yellow Wallpaper”*. The program I used to do this was Oxygen, a multi-platform XML editor. I was tasked with first marking up a google doc of the pages that had been previously transcribed. I made notes of all the sections within the document that I would need to put tags in when converting to XML. This allowed for a much smoother transition from google docs to oxygen.

## Google Docs

Dr. Stover provided us with a pre-transcribed version of our pages to avoid any confusion. The handwriting may have been difficult to understand in the original text, so this was extremely helpful. I went through the document and marked sections that I would need to put tags in. This included sections such as paragraph beginnings and endings, em-dashes, weird spaces, underlines, and strikethroughs. The most helpful aspect of this was marking the paragraph beginning and endings. Some paragraphs began on one page and ended on another, so I had to insert page breaks in the middle of paragraphs. Overall, I believe that this was the most essential aspect of the entire project. Although it did take a bit of time scanning the entire document to make sure I didn’t miss anything, it made the transition into oxygen very quick and simple.

## Oxygen

To my surprise using oxygen was the easiest part of this project. I have coded in the past, but am in no way an experienced coder. Following the video provided by Dr. Stover allowed me to easily set up my document. I had to code a website using XML earlier in the semester without an XML editor, so oxygen really made my life easy. Oxygen automatically closes tags for you saving a lot of unnecessary strain on the pinkies. Most of the code needed for marking up the document was provided by Dr. Stover. I found myself copy and pasting some of the code provided by Dr. Stover, so I guess that equals out the pinkie strain reduced by oxygen. Using my google doc I went through and put tags on everything I had made notes on. The process was quick, easy, and actually somewhat enjoyable. Seeing the green box in oxygen that meant all my code was working properly gave me a much needed serotonin boost.

This project seemed daunting at first, but turned out to be simple and enjoyable. Everytime I code I feel like that cool guy on the computer in the matrix, and because of that this has been my favorite project thus far. This project allowed me to obtain a deeper understanding of XML and TEI, and is something I look forward to doing again sometime in the future.
