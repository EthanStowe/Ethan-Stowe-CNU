### Summary

Bomb Sight maps all the locations bombed in London between July 10th, 1940, and June 6th, 1941. This project makes information available that was previously only accessible in the Reading Room at The National Archives. It displays how there was a bombing every few blocks throughout the entire city of London. When one thinks about the devastating impact these bombs had on the individuals who lived in London during this time, it is truly horrifying. Users can see all the locations that bombs hit, along with anti-invasion sites set up by the British.
