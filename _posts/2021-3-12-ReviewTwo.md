### Summary

Bomb Sight maps all the locations bombed in London between July 10th, 1940, and June 6th, 1941. This project makes information available that was previously only accessible in the Reading Room at The National Archives. It displays how there was a bombing every few blocks throughout the entire city of London. When one thinks about the devastating impact these bombs had on the individuals who lived in London during this time, it is truly horrifying. Users can see all the locations that bombs hit, along with anti-invasion sites set up by the British.

### Design

The project is a frightening display of the impact World War II had on mid 20th century London. The user can freely zoom in and out and pan to see all the locations of the bombings. Each bomb is marked with a red icon, and anti-invasion sites are marked in yellow. The site allows users to view different versions of the map, including a street view, satellite view, and a 1940’s map that originally showed the locations. When users select an individual bomb icon, they are given a brief description that includes the address of the bombing. The read more section on each icon shows the original address as well as the current address of the bombing. The project has an app for android with a virtual reality experience, and the project is also viewable on apple products.

### Relevance

This project does an excellent job at allowing people from all around the world to view information that was previously extremely limited. Individuals are typically taught history that directly relates to the region that they were raised in. This history of the bombings in London is something that is most likely looked over in most parts of the world. It’s important to understand the tragedy that occurred and the devastating impact World War II had on the world.

Project Director and Manager, Dr. Catherine Jones, is also a senior lecturer at Portsmith University. Many of the University of Portsmouth staff members contributed to the project. The mobile version of the project and the android app were designed by Dan Karran

### Findings

This project does a good job educating individuals on the horrific events that occurred in London during World War II. When a user first enters the site they are met with a screen with thousands of tiny red dots. It’s intuitive to zoom in with the scroll wheel to discover the meaning behind the dots, but there are no initial instructions on how to navigate the site. The information button on the map tab shows a brief explanation of how the site works and how to navigate. It would be helpful if this information box were to automatically open upon opening the site to better help users understand what to do. The red icons that indicate where bombs were dropped have different symbols to show what type of explosive it was. The bomb symbol on most is widely known and doesn’t need an explanation, but the other symbols require further explanation. To understand these symbols the user has to find the map legend, which is hidden under a question mark on the top right of the map. It would be helpful to include the legend somewhere in a static position where it is always in view. The button to the right of the legend allows you to toggle through different types of maps. This also seems to be hidden away, and some users may not notice that this is a feature. The inclusion of a variety of maps makes this project more engaging and visually appealing, so it’s important for users to be able to find these features. 

Overall, this project has done a great job creating an educational experience about information that previously would be difficult to obtain. It presents the information in a way that allows users to visualize how devastating the bombings were.
