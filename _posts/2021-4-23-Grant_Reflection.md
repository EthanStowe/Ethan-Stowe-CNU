# Grant Reflection

For my grant project, my partner and I decided to do a mapping of hazing deaths in the last 20 years. When we heard the tragic news of a student who had passed away at VCU, we thought that this project would be a good way to educate the public on this terrible practice. Our project will highlight hazing deaths at different universities, and allow users to read more about individual incidents. We felt that the topic of hazing is sometimes seen as a harmless right of passage. Attempting to change this narrative seems to be a nearly impossible task, but my partner and I felt that it would be helpful to get information to the public to slowly started helping people understand the harmful effects.

The mapping element of our project was slightly inspired by a project that I reviewed earlier in the semester for my Digital Humanities course. The project was *Bomb Sight, Mapping the WW2 Bombing Census.* When I first saw this project I was in awe of the number of bombs that had been dropped on London. For our project I wanted our viewers to feel the same. These maps help users better visualize the impact that something has on a community. In our project schools that have had more than one incident in the past 20 years will appear as a bigger bubble. I want our viewers to be able to understand how prominent of an issue hazing is in our society, and I feel like reading data from an article doesn’t fully demonstrate that.

When we first came up with the idea for this project my partner and I asked ourselves who would benefit from a project like this. At first, I thought this project would mainly benefit incoming college students trying to decide which university they want to attend. When writing our grant narrative we had to include which different types of people would benefit from our project, and this helped me realize that this project will actually be beneficial to a wide variety of people. College administrators could greatly benefit from the information this project would provide. They would be able to see trends in the data and pinpoint certain organizations that have a higher risk of causing these tragedies.

The process of actually completing this project has given me a better understanding of what I really want the project to be. Initially, I wanted to look at all hazing incidents that had happened over the past 50 years. Upon researching and consulting with Dr. Stover I realized that would require way too much information, and would be way too much work for two people with a small budget. Reporting all hazing incidents would be impossible considering most of these incidents aren’t even reported, and the ones that are reported typically have articles written about them but aren’t stored in any sort of database. We thought that hazing deaths would be easier to find considering the vast majority of hazing deaths are recording, and we found a few databases that will help us get started in recording them.

Coming into this course I had no idea what Digital Humanities were. I still struggle to define what they are, but this course has taught me to recognize Digital Humanities when I see them. One important aspect of everything that falls under the umbrella of Digital Humanities is to educate the user. Our project will serve this purpose by allowing users to read more about each incident, so hopefully, in their own lives, they’ll be able to avoid making the same mistakes. I’d like to think that the creation of this website could lead to individuals making better decisions regarding hazing in the future.
