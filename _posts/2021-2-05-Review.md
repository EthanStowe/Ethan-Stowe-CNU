### Summary

Jheronimus Bosch, the Garden of Earthly Delights is a virtual journey through the painting by Hieronymus Bosch. The project allows one to focus in on every aspect of the painting, and understand Bosch’s thought process throughout the work. The work is triptych, which means it was painted on three different panels, and then hinged together. Pieces such as these were typically used as altarpieces. The project directors goal was to allow the user to enjoy an immersive experience that will leave them questioning their own sins and morals. 

### Design

The project combines audio and visual elements in order to create an immersive and informative experience for the user. The user can freely scroll to zoom in and out on different areas of the painting. The user may also click on the white ribbon tabs in order to zoom in on a specific aspect of the work, and have an auditory explanation on that individual part. The explanation is an extremely in depth analysis, so this site may be suitable for individuals who are visually impaired. While exploring the project the user also is able to enjoy relaxing music. Although the project is most suitable for viewing on a computer, the site is still very user friendly on mobile devices such as smartphones and tablets. 

### Relevance

The project designers do a fantastic job combining virtual elements with a piece of art that is centuries old, making it accessible and understandable to a wide variety of users. The project director explains that although the piece is a story of moral and sin in a specific time period, this project allows users to apply the concepts to their own lives. This project allows for european heritage to be shared with individuals from all around the world.

### Findings

Jheronimus Bosch, the Garden of Earthly Delights is a beautiful combination of technology and art to create a captivating and enlightening experience. The peaceful music and pleasing visuals allow the user to get lost in the project. One can freely navigate through the work on their own, but users may also follow a guided tour. This allows for users to sit back and let the site take them through the painting, explaining details along the way. Navigating freely throughout the painting is very enjoyable, but if the user zooms out without pressing the back button they will no longer be able to see any of the white ribbon tabs. In order to get the tabs back the user has to go to the menu tab and click freely explore once again. This may be confusing to users unfamiliar with the site. On the main page of the project, the art is beautifully digitized. This allows users to zoom in without losing quality or the image to become pixelated, but if the user views the outer panels on the panels tab the work becomes very pixelated. 

Overall, this project creates a very enjoyable and educational experience. It brings to life a century old painting, and allows users to understand all aspects of the painting that they may not have without the explanations.
