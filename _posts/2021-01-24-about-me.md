##About Me Blog  

My name is Ethan Stowe, and I am a senior at Christopher Newport University. I was an Accounting and Finance double major, but now I am just an Accounting major. After graduating this Spring I will start a job with Baker Tilly, an accounting firm based in Tysons, VA, as an associate in commercial assurance. I did a virtual internship with them over this past summer.   

After graduation I will attempt to pass all sections of the CPA exam. This will be very difficult due to my lack of motivation to do any type of academic work. I guess being in school for 17 straight years has really started to wear on me. I only have 3 months left, and I am crawling to the finish line.  

Last summer I had the brilliant idea of getting a pug puppy named Mo while doing my internship. This has proved to be quite the challenge. I thought pugs were supposed to be lazy and sleep all day, but for some reason Mo is like a velociraptor that never runs out of energy. He has only peed on my bed 3 times this semester, which is starting off much better than last semester. Regardless of all the headache he causes, getting him was definitely one of the best decisions of my life.

Other hobbies of mine include playing video games and playing basketball. I used to play basketball a lot more than I do now, but freshman year of college I tore my ACL. I played competitive basketball my entire life leading up into college and never got seriously injured. When I decided to do something less competitive like intramurals I tore my ACL right away. At least now I have a really cool scar on my knee.    

Video games have always been a big part of my life. I enjoy FPS games, but I play a wide variety of genres. My favorite game of all time is The Last of Us. Recently I have used video games as a way to stay in touch with friends that don’t go to CNU. It’s nice to be able to talk to them for a few hours while playing games. This is also nice during the pandemic because you can talk and feel like you’re hanging out without seeing each other in person.
